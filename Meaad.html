                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>At the University of Jeddah's College of Computing and Information Technology, I am presently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. I am anticipated to graduate in the middle of 2025. My studies began in 2022. C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, data science, and software development are among the subjects I've studied.</p>
                <p>I've taken part in online cybersecurity courses and been awarded Academic Excellence Certificates every year. I intend to work on obtaining professional credentials like the <i>Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate</i> and the <i>Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)</i>.</p>

                    <h3><i>ParkSmart App</i></h3>
                    <p>In this project on the course <i>"Principles of Software Engineering"</i> a group of students and I have established an assistance application and mitigated the problem of traffic congestion under the title <i>"ParkSmart App"</i>. The most important thing this project offers is that you can make sure that there is empty parking in a certain place that you choose during the application and book the parking for the car if you want. There is also the improvement and renewal of attitudes with special needs. I hope for the future that I will oversee its application because it is a great project and it will make a huge difference if it is applied on the ground.</p>
